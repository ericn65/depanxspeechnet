    "In this notebook, I'm going to use all the information seen before to build and end-to-end jointly supervised learning of Depresion and Anxiety.\n",
    "I will use a new dataset which will consider an encoder (the PHQ-8 pre-trained model) and 2 workers, one for anxiety and one for depresion. As we want all the hard task coming from the encoding and found similarities of co-morbidities, the 2 workers will be just a fully-connected layer from the Q-RNN output of the model to the number of classes of each co-morbidity.
